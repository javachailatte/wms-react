# Where's My Stuff (React)

You can find a very basic guide for the project [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Dependencies
- [Node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- ` npm i -g yarn `

## Setup
```
git clone https://github.com/javachailatte/wmsr 
yarn install 
```

## Yarn

### ` yarn start ` 
- starts a local server at `https://localhost:3000`
- Changes made to javascript will be applied on reload.
- In general, don't make changes to public folder (they won't auto reload either)

### ` yarn deploy `
- ### THIS PUSHES YOUR FILES TO PRODUCTION
